This guide is divided into four parts. The first ['How do I?'](backtesting-faq.md)
explains how to do many common tasks. The second part ['Guide'](backtesting-overview.md) details
the relevant parts of the code, and explains how to modify or create new parts.
The third part ['Processes'](backtesting-process.md) discusses certain processes that cut
across multiple parts of the code in more detail. The final part
['Reference'](backtesting-process.md) includes lists of methods and parameters.
